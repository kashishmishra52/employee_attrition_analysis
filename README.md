# employee_attrition_analysis
📌 Overview

This project analyzes employee attrition trends using an HR dataset. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to attrition (like salary, overtime, and job role) and build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of employees leaving.

🚀 Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Attrition trends by department, salary, and overtime.

Correlation analysis between features.

Visualizations: Bar charts, heatmaps, and attrition breakdowns using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

Predictive Modeling: Logistic Regression model achieving ~80% accuracy.

Insights: Provided actionable findings for HR to reduce attrition risk.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

📂 Dataset

The project uses the IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset (available on Kaggle
).

📊 Results

Overtime workers had significantly higher attrition rates.

Lower salary bands and certain job roles showed higher turnover.

Logistic Regression model reached ~80% accuracy in predicting attrition.


🔮 Future Improvements

Experiment with advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost).

Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI.

Apply feature importance analysis for deeper insights.
